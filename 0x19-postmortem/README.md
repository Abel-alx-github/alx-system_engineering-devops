0x19-postmortem



Issue Summary:
Duration: The misconfiguration occurred from April 12, 2024, 10:00 AM to April 12, 2024, 2:00 PM (UTC).

Impact: The misconfiguration led to the Apache server being inaccessible, causing service disruptions for users, 500 internal error. Approximately 70% of users experienced slow or unavailable services.


Timeline:
10:00 AM: The issue was detected when users started reporting errors while accessing the website.

Actions taken: The customer support team immediately escalated the issue to the operations team. The assumption was that the server load was causing the slowdown.

Misleading investigation paths: The operations team initially focused on optimizing the server configuration and scaling resources to handle the increased load.

Escalation: As the issue persisted, the incident was escalated to the system administrators and network engineers responsible for the Apache server.
11:30 AM: Further analysis revealed that there was a misconfiguration in the Apache server's virtual host settings.
Resolution: The misconfiguration was corrected by updating the virtual host configuration file, and the Apache server was restarted to apply the changes.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root cause: The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the virtual host settings of the Apache server. This misconfiguration resulted in incorrect routing and prevented users from accessing the website properly.

Resolution: The misconfiguration was rectified by adjusting the virtual host configuration file to ensure proper routing and functionality. After the changes were applied, the Apache server was restarted to implement the corrected configuration.


Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvement/Fixes:
Develop and follow a standardized configuration management process for Apache server setups to minimize the risk of misconfigurations.

Implement regular audits and reviews of server configurations to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations or inconsistencies.

Enhance testing procedures to include validation of virtual host configurations during deployment or server updates.

Tasks to address the issue:

Conduct a thorough audit of existing Apache server configurations to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations.

Implement automated testing and validation procedures to verify the correctness of virtual host configurations during server updates or deployments.
